# Combinatorics

- Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures.
- The branch of mathematics dealing with combinations of objects belonging to a finite set in accordance with certain constraints.
- Aspects of combinatorics include:
  - __enumerative__ combinatorics: counting the structures of a given kind and size
    - Most classical area
    - Concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.
    - Fibonacci is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics.
  - __combinatorial designs__: deciding when certain criteria can be met
  - __matroid theory__:  constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria
  - __extremal combinatorics__: finding "largest", "smallest" objects
  - __combinatoral optimization__: finding "optimal" objects
  - __algebraic combinatorics__: applying algebraic techniques to combinatoric problems
- One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory.
- Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms.

## Personal Notes

This topic is way too huge to fit into one afternoon of note taking.
