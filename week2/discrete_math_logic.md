# Discrete Mathematics
 - The study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.
 - Discrete objects can be enumerated by integers.
 - Calculus is excluded from Discrete Mathematics.

## Logic
 - Logic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference.
 - Logical formulas are discrete structures,a s are proofs, which form finite trees or, more generally, directed acyclic graph structures (with each inference step combining one of more premise branches to give a single conclusion).
- Mathematical logic is divided into fields:
  - set theory
  - model theory
  - recursion theory
  - proof theory

## Rachel's Notes
Again, I didn't get too far with the notes here, but I did all I had time for today. A lot of what is talked about in the link above will be explained in future weeks, so I'm not too concerned.
